### Day 2: Netflix Content Strategy Analysis

**Project Overview:**  
This project provides a comprehensive analysis of Netflix's content strategy through exploratory data analysis (EDA) of their content catalog. The analysis examines content distribution patterns, acquisition strategies, and key insights into how Netflix curates and manages its vast library of movies and TV shows.

**Objective:**  
Perform in-depth exploratory data analysis on Netflix's content dataset and answer critical business questions about their content strategy, including rating distributions, content freshness, production trends, and key content creators.

**Dataset Information:**  
- **Source:** Netflix content catalog dataset  
- **Content Types:** Movies and TV Shows  
- **Time Period:** 2008–2021  
- **Key Features:** Title, type, director, cast, country, date added, release year, rating, duration, genre, description

**Analysis Workflow:**  
1. **Data Loading and Exploration:**  
   - Dataset import and initial inspection  
   - Data quality assessment and missing value analysis  
   - Basic statistical overview  

2. **Data Cleaning and Preprocessing:**  
   - Handle missing values  
   - Data type conversions  
   - Feature engineering (content age calculation)  
   - Text preprocessing for description analysis  

3. **Comprehensive EDA and Question Analysis:**  
   - **Q1:** Content Ratings Distribution Over Time → rating trends, audience preferences  
   - **Q2:** Content Age vs Content Type → movies vs TV shows freshness  
   - **Q3:** Production Trends → release year vs added year analysis  
   - **Q4:** Content Description Text Analysis → word frequency, themes, word cloud  
   - **Q5:** Top Directors Analysis → most prolific directors, content volume
