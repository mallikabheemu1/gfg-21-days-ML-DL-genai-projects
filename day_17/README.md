# Day 17: Build Your Own Intelligent Internet Search Engine

## Project Overview

This project demonstrates the implementation of an intelligent web crawler using Crawl4AI, an open-source AI-powered web scraping framework. The assignment focuses on building a Breadth-First Search (BFS) web crawler capable of systematically exploring Wikipedia's link structure to a specified depth, showcasing modern web scraping techniques optimized for AI and data extraction workflows.

The implementation leverages asynchronous programming and advanced crawling strategies to efficiently navigate and extract data from large-scale websites while respecting domain boundaries and managing crawl depth.

## Assignment Requirements

The assignment challenge was to:

**"Can you run a BFS Crawl on Wikipedia?"**

**Specific Requirements:**
- Implement a BFS (Breadth-First Search) crawl on Wikipedia
- Use the crawl4ai library with `BFSDeepCrawlStrategy`
- Configure crawl parameters:
  - `max_depth=2` (crawl up to 2 levels deep)
  - `include_external=False` (stay within Wikipedia domain)
  - `max_pages=500` (limit total pages for practical execution time)
- Target URL: `https://www.wikipedia.org`
- Save crawl output to a text file
- Run locally (not compatible with Google Colab due to browser requirements)

## Installation and Setup

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or higher
- Windows, macOS, or Linux operating system
- Minimum 4GB RAM (8GB recommended)
- Internet connection for crawling

### Required Dependencies

```bash
pip install crawl4ai
playwright install
```

### Complete Installation Steps

1. **Install Crawl4AI:**
   ```bash
   pip install crawl4ai
   ```

2. **Install Playwright Browsers:**
   ```bash
   playwright install
   ```
   This downloads the necessary browser binaries (Chromium, Firefox, WebKit).

3. **Verify Installation:**
   ```bash
   python -c "import crawl4ai; print('Crawl4AI installed successfully')"
   ```

## Usage Instructions

### Method 1: Running the Standalone Script

Execute the Python script directly:

```bash
cd Day_17
python run_and_save_output.py
```

This will:
- Start the BFS crawler on Wikipedia
- Display real-time progress in the console
- Save all output to `Output.txt`
- Show summary statistics upon completion

### Method 2: Running in Jupyter Notebook

1. Open the assignment notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook Assignment_BFS_Web_Crawler.ipynb
   ```

2. Execute all cells sequentially

3. Output will be displayed inline and saved to `Output.txt`

### Method 3: Using the Core Code

```python
import asyncio
from crawl4ai import AsyncWebCrawler, CrawlerRunConfig
from crawl4ai.deep_crawling import BFSDeepCrawlStrategy
from crawl4ai.content_scraping_strategy import LXMLWebScrapingStrategy

async def main():
    # Configure BFS crawl
    config = CrawlerRunConfig(
        deep_crawl_strategy=BFSDeepCrawlStrategy(
            max_depth=2,
            max_pages=500,
            include_external=False
        ),
        scraping_strategy=LXMLWebScrapingStrategy(),
        verbose=True
    )
    
    # Execute crawl
    async with AsyncWebCrawler() as crawler:
        results = await crawler.arun("https://www.wikipedia.org", config=config)
        
        print(f"Crawled {len(results)} pages in total")
        
        # Process results
        for result in results[:3]:
            print(f"URL: {result.url}")
            print(f"Depth: {result.metadata.get('depth', 0)}")
            print(f"Title: {result.metadata.get('title', 'N/A')}")

# Run the crawler
asyncio.run(main())
```

## Implementation Details

### BFS Crawling Strategy

The Breadth-First Search strategy explores web pages level by level:

1. **Level 0 (Depth 0):** Start page (`https://www.wikipedia.org`)
2. **Level 1 (Depth 1):** All pages linked from the start page
3. **Level 2 (Depth 2):** All pages linked from Level 1 pages

**Configuration Parameters:**

```python
BFSDeepCrawlStrategy(
    max_depth=2,           # Maximum crawl depth
    max_pages=500,         # Maximum total pages to crawl
    include_external=False # Only crawl internal Wikipedia links
)
```

### Output Redirection

The implementation uses a custom `TeeOutput` class to simultaneously:
- Display output in the console
- Write output to `Output.txt`
- Capture output for notebook integration

```python
class TeeOutput:
    def __init__(self, *files):
        self.files = files
    
    def write(self, data):
        for f in self.files:
            f.write(data)
            f.flush()
    
    def flush(self):
        for f in self.files:
            f.flush()
```

### Crawl Progress Tracking

The crawler provides real-time feedback for each page:

```
[FETCH]... ↓ https://ab.wikipedia.org    | ✓ | ⏱: 1.09s
[SCRAPE].. ◆ https://ab.wikipedia.org    | ✓ | ⏱: 0.25s
[COMPLETE] ● https://ab.wikipedia.org    | ✓ | ⏱: 1.35s
```

- **FETCH:** Downloading the page
- **SCRAPE:** Extracting content
- **COMPLETE:** Processing finished

## Crawl Results

### Execution Summary

Based on the `Output.txt` file:

- **Total Pages Crawled:** Multiple Wikipedia language editions
- **Crawl Strategy:** BFS (Breadth-First Search)
- **Maximum Depth:** 2 levels

2. **Resource Consumption**
   - Memory usage increases with page count
   - CPU intensive during scraping
   - Network bandwidth dependent

3. **Crawl Time**
   - Large crawls can take significant time
   - 500 pages may take 10-30 minutes
   - Depends on network speed and site responsiveness

4. **Rate Limiting**
   - Should respect robots.txt
   - May need delays between requests
   - Risk of IP blocking with aggressive crawling

## Best Practices

1. **Respect Website Policies**
   - Check robots.txt before crawling
   - Implement appropriate delays
   - Limit concurrent requests

2. **Manage Crawl Scope**
   - Set reasonable max_depth values
   - Use max_pages to limit execution time
   - Filter by domain when appropriate

3. **Error Handling**
   - Implement retry logic for failed requests
   - Log errors for debugging
   - Handle timeouts gracefully

4. **Resource Management**
   - Monitor memory usage
   - Close browser sessions properly
   - Clean up temporary files
