## Submission Criteria

This assignment fulfills two specific requirements:

1. **Gender vs. Spending Score Analysis**: Analyze relationship between gender and spending patterns with statistical significance testing
2. **Feature Engineering for Clustering**: Create new features and perform clustering with optimal cluster determination

## Analysis Workflow

### Step 1: Setup and Data Loading
- Import essential libraries (pandas, numpy, sklearn, matplotlib, seaborn)
- Load mall customer dataset from data directory
- Initial data exploration and quality assessment

### Part 1: Gender vs. Spending Score Analysis

#### Statistical Analysis
- **Descriptive Statistics**: Comprehensive analysis by gender groups
- **Distribution Analysis**: Gender distribution and spending score characteristics
- **Hypothesis Testing**: 
  - Independent t-test for mean differences
  - Mann-Whitney U test for non-parametric comparison
  - Effect size calculation (Cohen's d)

#### Comprehensive Visualizations
- Box plots showing spending distribution by gender
- Violin plots displaying density distributions
- Normalized histograms for direct comparison
- Mean comparison bar charts with error bars
- Scatter plots: Age vs Spending Score by gender
- Scatter plots: Income vs Spending Score by gender

#### Statistical Results
- **Male Spending**: Mean 48.51, Std 27.90
- **Female Spending**: Mean 51.53, Std 24.11
- **T-test p-value**: 0.4137 (not significant)
- **Effect Size**: -0.1167 (negligible)
- **Conclusion**: Gender does NOT significantly influence spending behavior

### Part 2: Feature Engineering for Clustering

#### Feature Engineering Process
- **Income-to-Spending Ratio**: Annual Income / Spending Score
  - Higher values = conservative spenders
  - Lower values = enthusiastic spenders
- **Age Group (Numeric)**: Categorical age groupings (1=Young, 2=Adult, 3=Middle-aged, 4=Senior)
- **Customer Value Score**: Weighted combination (0.6 × Normalized Income + 0.4 × Normalized Spending)
- **Spending Efficiency**: Spending Score / Age (spending intensity per year)

#### Clustering Implementation
- **Feature Selection**: 6 features (3 original + 3 engineered)
- **Data Preprocessing**: StandardScaler normalization
- **Quality Assurance**: NaN and infinite value handling

#### Optimal Cluster Determination
- **Elbow Method**: WCSS analysis for k=1 to 10
- **Silhouette Analysis**: Cluster separation quality assessment
- **Optimal k**: 7 clusters (highest silhouette score: 0.441)
- **Final WCSS**: 216.18

#### Cluster Analysis and Visualization
- **6-Panel Comprehensive Visualization**:
  - 2D scatter plots with multiple feature combinations
  - 3D scatter plot for multi-dimensional perspective
  - Cluster size distribution analysis
  - Feature importance heatmap by cluster
- **Cluster Distribution**: 7 segments ranging from 1.0% to 23.0% of customers

## Key Results

### Gender Analysis Findings
- **Statistical Conclusion**: No significant gender effect on spending (p > 0.05)
- **Business Implication**: Gender-neutral marketing strategies recommended
- **Alternative Focus**: Age and income identified as primary segmentation variables

### Customer Segmentation Results
- **7 Distinct Clusters**: Successfully identified customer personas
- **Cluster Quality**: Silhouette score of 0.441 indicates good separation
- **Feature Engineering Impact**: Engineered features enhanced clustering effectiveness

### Cluster Characteristics
- **High-Value Customers**: High income, high spending segments
- **Conservative Affluent**: High income, low spending segments  
- **Enthusiastic Spenders**: Low income, high spending segments
- **Budget-Conscious**: Low income, low spending segments
- **Moderate Customers**: Balanced income and spending patterns

### Business Insights
