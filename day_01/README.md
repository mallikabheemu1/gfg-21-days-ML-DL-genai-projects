# üö¢ Day 01: Data Storytelling ‚Äî Analyzing Survival on the Titanic

## üìò Project Overview
This project performs a **comprehensive Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** on the Titanic dataset to uncover key factors that influenced passenger survival.  
It follows a complete **data science workflow** ‚Äî from data loading and cleaning to visualization, profiling, and insight generation.

---

## üéØ Objective
To perform a step-by-step EDA that uncovers insights about survival patterns on the Titanic.  
Covers **data loading, cleaning, analysis, feature engineering, and visualization** with theoretical explanations at each stage.

---

## üß© Dataset
- **Source:** Titanic passenger dataset  
- **Size:** 891 passengers, 12 features  
- **Key Variables:** Passenger Class, Gender, Age, Fare, Embarkation Port, Survival Status  

---

## üîç Analysis Workflow

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Data Loading & Initial Exploration
- Loaded Titanic dataset from CSV  
- Examined structure, data types, and dimensions  
- Identified missing values and data quality issues  

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Data Cleaning & Preprocessing
**Missing Value Treatment:**  
- `Age`: Filled missing values with median age  
- `Embarked`: Filled missing values with mode  
- `Cabin`: Created binary feature `Has_Cabin` due to 77% missing values  

**Feature Engineering:**  
- Extracted **titles** from passenger names  
- Created categorical variables  
- Binned continuous variables for better analysis  

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Exploratory Data Analysis
- **Survival Analysis:** Overall survival rate ‚Äî 38.4%  
- **Demographic Insights:** Gender, age, and class trends  
- **Correlation Analysis:** Relationships between variables  
- **Visualization:** Histograms, boxplots, countplots, heatmaps  

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Data Profiling
- Generated an **interactive HTML profiling report** using `ydata-profiling`  
- Included summary statistics, correlations, and missing value patterns  

---

## üß† Key Findings
- **Gender Effect:** Females had higher survival rates  
- **Class Impact:** Higher classes survived more  
- **Age Patterns:** Younger passengers had higher survival probabilities  
- **Embarkation Port:** Survival rates varied by port
